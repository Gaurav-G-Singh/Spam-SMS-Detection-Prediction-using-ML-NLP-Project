# SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a robust SMS spam detection system using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The system will analyze incoming SMS messages and classify them as either spam or non-spam.

Features:
Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization: Break down the SMS messages into individual words.
Stopword Removal: Remove common words that do not contribute much to the classification.
Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
Feature Extraction:
Convert the processed text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Machine Learning Model:
Choose a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models like LSTM).
Train the model on a labeled dataset containing examples of spam and non-spam SMS.
Model Evaluation:
Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Fine-tune the model based on the evaluation results.
User Interface:
Develop a user-friendly interface for users to input SMS messages and receive classification results.
Include a reporting feature for users to mark false positives or false negatives and improve the model over time.
Report Generation:
Implement a reporting system that allows users to generate a detailed report on the SMS messages, including the classification results and any user-reported feedback.
Integration with Mobile Devices:
Provide instructions or code snippets for integrating the spam detection system with mobile devices, allowing users to filter SMS messages in real-time.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the machine learning model and NLP techniques.
Scikit-learn: Utilize the Scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks such as model training, evaluation, and feature extraction.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Leverage NLTK for NLP preprocessing tasks.
