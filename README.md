# Spam-SMS-Detection-Prediction-using-ML-NLP-Project
Overview
This project aims to build a robust and efficient spam SMS detection system using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content.

Key Features
Machine Learning Model: Implement a machine learning model, such as a Naive Bayes classifier or a Support Vector Machine, to analyze the text content of SMS messages and make predictions.
Natural Language Processing: Utilize NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze the textual data. This may include tokenization, stemming, and feature extraction to convert the text into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Dataset: Use a labeled dataset containing examples of both spam and non-spam SMS messages. Explore publicly available datasets or create your own dataset by collecting and labeling SMS messages.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
User Interface (Optional): Create a simple user interface where users can input an SMS message, and the model provides a prediction on whether it is spam or not.
Deployment: Explore options for deploying the model, such as creating a web service or integrating it into a mobile application.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the machine learning model and NLP techniques.
Scikit-learn: Utilize the Scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks such as model training, evaluation, and feature extraction.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Leverage NLTK for NLP preprocessing tasks.
Flask (Optional): If creating a web service, consider using Flask as a lightweight web framework for deployment.
